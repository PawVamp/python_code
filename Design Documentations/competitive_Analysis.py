Competitive Analysis:
	I have played multiple versions of Mahjong Solitiaire that is available online. And there were some pros 
	and cons to the game that I will like to take into consideratio as I am making my own Mahjong Solitiare.
    
    http://www.freegames.ws/games/boardgames/mahjong/mahjong.htm
            
	CONS:
	1. I do not like the fact they do not have a start/instruction page
	2. They only have one board for the users to play
	3. They do not have any hint function
	4. They do not have any timer for the users to know how long it took them to play the game. 

	PROS:
	1. The board is very well drawn
	2. It does not let the user to click on the board that is illegal

	CONS:
	1. I do not like the fact that they did not have the instruction button on the game itself. It took me awhile
	   to figure out where the instruction was because it was located at the page not at the game itself
	2. I think Undo button is not necessary 
	3. They only have one board to play the game (maybe have some more variability for the users to play different 
		levels of the game)

	PROS:
	1. I like the fact that it has a timer that allows the users to know how long it took them to finish the game
	2. I also like the hint function they had 
	3. Also the "new game" button that allows the players to start a new game if they desire to do so

	CONS 
	1. I do not think undo button is necessary because if undo button is possible, then everyone will be able 
	   to win the game. 
	2. I want a seperate page for the opening page where the user can choose to see the instructions of the game 
	
	PRos
	1. I like the fact that the game has a Layout where they can choose more than one board
	2. I also like the tileset function that allows the user to choose different tiles (If I can, I will
		definitely want to implement this function to the game)

	CONS:
	1. Undo Button not necessary, in my opinion 

	PROS:
	1. Different Levels for the users (Kiddie, Easy, Normal Hard)
	2. Different board layout for the users to play 
	3. Shuffle, Hint features 

	#I do not think Undo button is necessary, but it seems that most of the reference that I have searched all have 
	a "undo" function, so I might add a undo function (I will decide on this later)
