Project Proposal:
	For my final term project, I would like to create “Mahjong Solitaire” game. Mahjong Solitaire, 
	also known as Shanghai, is a kind of matching game that uses mahjong tiles instead of sets of cards.
	In total there are 144 mahjong tiles that is usually arranged in four-layer pattern. The goal of 
	the game is to match visible pairs of identical tiles from the board. The game is finished either 
	if all the pair of tiles has been removed or there is no possible exposed pairs remaining. 

	The overall problem for me is to create the game :Mahjong Solitiare, with sub problems as 
		1. Making the board using pygame and image downloaded and saved from the internet
			Make sure the board always draw all 144 (72 pairs of different tiles)
				Each board will have multiple layers of tile 
		2. Learn how to make the board(tile) click and disappear (Only when they manage to click a pair
			that is located at the legal place) so that the next level of tile can appear. 
				Legal Board = board that is placed in a position that even if it is moved around right or left
				it will not disturb other tile. 
		3. Hint function using Recursion 
		4. Create different types of board 
		5. Set a Timer that will allow the users to know how long it took them to play the game 
		6. Intro Page/ Instructions and other additional functions that I want to add to the game. 
		7. Get the game played by multiple people to make sure that the game is user-friendly
