\f0\fs24 \cf0 User-Experience:\
	Based on the competitive Analysis that I have written two weeks ago, I have created the user-interface for my game. \
	When you start the game, I have two buttons that user can choose from, which is help and start button. When you click on the help button, instructions to the game are shown to allow the readers to understand the game they are about to play.  Then, when you go back to the menu by clicking the menu button, and start the game, users are lead into level page where they can choose three different levels of the game. The Easy level has two pair of tiles, Medium Level has eight different tiles and Hard Level has the original mahjong Tiles, which includes several different tiles. When you actually start playing the game, user has a \'93hint\'94 function where they can press if they cannot find the possible legal tile. When you press the button, the tile will light up hinting the possible tile. However, if there is no legal tile available \'93Game Over\'94 board will show up with two option: Restart or Shuffle. When you click on the \'93Shuffle\'94 the users are able to replay the game they were playing but with tiles placed in different positions as it was before. If you press, \'93restart\'94 you are guided back to the level page where you can choose the level of the game you want to play.
